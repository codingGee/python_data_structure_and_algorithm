# Algorithm
Compute the greatest common divisor of
two nonnegative integers p and q as follows:

If q is 0, the answer is p. If not, divide p by q
The answer is the this book, we use computer programs to de-
greatest common divisor of q and r

    The operators * and / (and % ) have higher precedence than (are applied before) the + and - operators; among logical operators, ! is the highest precedence, followed by && and then || . Generally,
    operators of the same precedence are applied left to right. As in standard arithmetic ex-pressions, you can use parentheses to override these rules.

A program is a sequence of statements, with declarations, assignments, conditionals,
